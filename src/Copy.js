    <b>What is Iteratoor?</b><br></br>
    Iteratoor 1.0 is an edition of 420 ERC-721 NFTs created by hand in Figma. Iteratoor is a collaborative visual language based on repetition: a way to explore form and meaning through an iterative process of combining and remixing simple forms into complex forms. Through making many versions, we allow the art to speak to us and through us.

    <b>What does creative commons zero - public domain mean?</b>
    <br></br>
    Anyone may use the individual elements of the system, in any way they choose, including creating work to sell.  We encourage you to play with and remix these elements and see what they have to say to you.

    <b>How many can I mint?â€¨</b><br></br>
    You can mint up to 10 Iteratoors per transaction.<br></br><br></br><br></br>
    <b>How does rarity work?</b><br></br>
â€¨There are 12 different species of Iteratoors in 1.0. Each has different levels of evolution, and different colorways like <span className="indigloCopy"><b>Indiglo</b></span> and <span className="roseGoldCopy"><b>RoseGold</b></span>. There are 35 iterations in each species. Minting order is randomized.
    <br></br><br></br><br></br>
    <b>What utility do they have?</b><br></br>
    By participating in the Iteratoor 1.0 mint, you are supporting the development of an open source design system, and helping grow a treasury to produce future cycles of Iteratoor and collect Iteratoors created by our community.
